# Create a Custom Cloud Computer

In this lab we're going to use the power of LearnIDE to create a computer in
the cloud. Whenever you reconnect to this lab, you're going to have all the
data you left on it **right there**.

We're giving you this "cloud computer" so that you can focus on learning to
build great web sites instead of downloading tools and learning tools. You know
that feeling you get when you see what people can do with Photoshop. And then
you open Photoshop and you realize you're going to need to read 5 books on
Photoshop in order to do something cool. Yeah, we want the **reverse** of that
feeling :)

## Creation

Just by reading this lab in Learn, it was created for you! Awesome!

Let's prove it. In the Learn Terminal type:

`date > remember_me.txt`

This will put the current date and time into a file called `remember_me.txt`

Now. Close this tab! Close learn! Close everything! If you're feeling
particularly daring feel free to reboot your local machine although that's not
necessary! Then log back into Learn and return to this lesson.

Type `cat remember_me.txt`. You'll see the old date is still in there. That
means that you can use this lab as a "virtual computer in the cloud." How cool
is that?! We think it's very cool and hope you will too.

While you'll work through many labs and readmes in this course, you can always
return to this lab and pick up where you left off. You can use this as a
staging computer for your "Portfolio Projects" or for a personal website about
yourself. We don't know where your creativity will lead you, but we're excited
to see what you do!
